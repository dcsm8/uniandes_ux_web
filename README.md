## Development Environment Setup

Before running the uniandes_ux_web, ensure your development environment includes the following prerequisites:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Angular requires Node.js. It's recommended to use the latest LTS version. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Angular CLI**: This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.2.1. Install the Angular CLI globally using npm by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` in the terminal.

### Running the Application

1. **Development Server**: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
2. **Code Scaffolding**: Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
3. **Build**: Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. You need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
